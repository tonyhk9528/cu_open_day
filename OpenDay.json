Money ran short for this project, however, and although the side-wings were completed in the 1960s the planned Great Hall has never been built.\r\n\r\nWater refill locations: \r\n\r\nGround Floor  \r\n- Room 0.91 North corridorÂ \r\n\r\n1st Floor \r\n- Room 1.75 next to the male toilets\r\n- Opposite Council Chamber near Library\r\n- Inside the cafe\r\n",
